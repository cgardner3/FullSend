#### Project Management Tool and Task Difficulty Estimation

One of the first steps the team will undertake is to determine which atomic tasks it will undertake from your project management tool. Note that some additional tasks (such as deploying infrastructure will have to be added to the Atomic Task list). We will work this sprint using a points estimation process -- this process is commonly used in industry to give an evolving estimate of software readiness and complexity. Your team will use a scale of 1-5 points. 5 being a hard task and 1 being a simple task. These numbers are purely relative to your own team's estimation of your own abilities. For Sprint 2 you will start with 25 total points of tasks to be assigned amongst the group members. If you finish them all, you can add increments of 15 points. If you don't finish them, as long as you are progressing, your team will reevaluate their numerical rankings of tasks in the next sprint.

In the Project Management tool the 25 points worth of tasks need to have the point value assigned to that task and also have a name that is primary responsible and clearly marked. This is how your Project Manager will report progress and how you will write your own and group critique at the end of the sprint. The professor will check in weekly during the beginning of the Lab days to check the current progress and help coordinate in anyway.

Note -- this may require the group to Swarm on some initial items so that items that are blocking progress of the entire application don't hold up the entire team. Remember as a team-member it is your duty to swarm problems and solve them as a team (Third Way).

We'll be deciding difficulty together in group meeting.
