<h1>Rock Climbing Matchmaking Web Application</h1>
<p>Name: <strong>Full Send</strong><br />
Target Audience: Rock climbers of all levels</p>
<p>Our application, named Full Send, is a fully functional three-tier web application meant to bring climbers in the Chicago location together.  It is our understanding that climbers can have a rough time finding a partner to climb with, especially one that suits their needs or desires.  Full Send looks to bridge the divide between climbers who wish to look for a partner or perhaps multiple partners to socialize, become stronger climbers, and take the overall next step in furthering their climbing goals.<br />
The way our application works is the user can go to the website by connecting to iit.edu network through VPN using AnyConnect, and then search https://system60.rice.iit.edu in the URL field.  This will lead users to a login page welcoming the user.  We have enabled google authentication for our login process, meaning any user with a google account can log into the website using their google account username and password.<br />
Once authenticated, users are directed to the profile page, where they can fill out their Full Send profile with information about themselves that other climbers will see in their discover page.  The information in this profile includes the user’s name, pronouns, a little bio/description for themselves, gym locations they often go to(limited to Chicagoland area), climbing types they partake in, their level of experience, what days they’re available, and their discord username for communication off the app.  Once this information is filled out and submitted using the button at the bottom of the page, they are directed to the discover page.
The discover page is where all user profiles can be seen by other users, and they can gather information on who fits the type of partner they want.  Once the user looks through all the user profiles they want to look through, they can move on to the matches page.<br />
The matches page lists all the users, and the currently logged-in user can check each user they want as a partner.  The user then submits the form after they finish deciding which profiles they like and want to match with. This information gets sent and recorded in our backend database, where we can then look to notify other users of matches (as of now the matches feature just sends the matches to the backend, there isn’t any implemented method of notifying other matched users).  After pressing the submit button, it makes the user get sent to the messages page.
The messages page is a page that allows users to communicate with other users.  All the user has to do, is put in their name, the message they want to post, and then submit with the comment button.  There is a pane underneath the input form where you can see a forum where people post and reply to messages.
The next page that is accessible on our website is the settings page.  This page gives users the ability to change the theme of the website between three options: light, dark, and black (these themes don’t stay consistent when exiting this page, still work to be done).  There is also a contact us form, so users can directly connect with the Full Send team.  Lastly, there is a logout button in this page.  There is another logout button included in the lefthand side menu, and both of these buttons perform the same function: logging out the user and returning them to the login page.
Full Send is by no means a perfect website and there is plenty of work to be done.  Our team was ambitious in its creation, and through the hard work put into it throughout the semester, it has become something our team can look at and be proud, knowing we reached many of the goals we set out to accomplish.</p>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>The Full Send web application is comprised mostly Python code using the Django web framework to develop our website.  We used MariaDB for our backend database, where we had mostly user profiles being stored, along with google authentication account information.  Nginx was used for our frontend webserver instances, to display the site.  All of the components needed to host our services and the three tiers for the web application were provided through virtual instances on Proxmox, provided by IIT cloud resources.  Deployment was conducted using Terraform.</p>
<h2>Knowledge Gained</h2>
<p>There was a lot of knowledge gained throughout the entire project.  Some main takeaways were the differences between creating a project locally and then trying to implement that project into production.  There are many tutorials on how to do projects locally, but there aren’t nearly as many when it comes to doing this in a production environment.  Another takeaway is that communication is key, we had a good method of communication through not only our discord server, but also other methods like through just normal texting.  This allows for everyone to work together much more seamlessly and whenever there was an issue that needed to be addressed, people would know about it.  Lastly, when splitting up the tasks based on roles and responsibilities in each sprint, it was very useful to have contingencies in place in case someone wasn’t able to perform their duties.  This could be as simple as assigning two people to a high level task, or making sure we knew any possible conflicts that might emerge within the sprint.  Everyone was very good about this, and it was also the fact that we had at least two meetings per week to discuss relevant updates.  If this wasn’t the case, our team would have a rough time finishing tasks.</p>
