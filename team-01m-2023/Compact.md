### How work will flow
Team will meet every Friday at  **4:30 pm on Discord**. This weekly meeting will be used to check-in on each other to ensure everyone is on track. The  project manager will screen share the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/Dzwdgt0j/itmt430-team01) to keep track of everyone's progress of each task. All deliverables should be submitted by **Sunday evening**.

### Communication rules and methods
- All forms of communication will be held on Discord, including virtual meetings.
- All individual members should message the team or at least the project manager if any issues comes up.
- Try your best to respond to your team members as soon as possible.
- Give the team at least a **30 minutes heads up** before the start of meetings if you can't make it for any reason.

### Consequences
Those that are non-compliant with the Team Charter will be held accountable for their actions.
Consequences include:
1. Warning: The project manager will issue a warning to individuals who are slacking.
2. Smack: The project manager will issue a smack across the face of any disobeying individual.
3. Kicked out: As the third strike, you'll be kicked out of the team.

### Restoration methods
Individual:
After the first warning, the screw up and the project manager will have a call to discuss viable solutions to ensure the problem will be resolved and prevented from happening again in the future. If the problem is ever escalated, the entire group will be brought in for further discussion. 

Team:
If the team collectively doesn't meet expectations, a meeting will be used to discussed what mistakes were made and what improvements should be implemented moving forward.
