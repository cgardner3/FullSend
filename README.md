A three-tier website (frontend web server, backend database, load-balancer) built from Packer and Terraform Scripts. Website hosted through Django Programming Framework and Nginx. Gunicorn and service files allow for the Django and Nginx services to start up on boot. MongoDB was used for backend database storage. Copy of my team repository code used this semester.
